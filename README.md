## Bash

### fullscreen.sh

- Requires wmctrl, this can be acquired through apt.
- Takes in an app name, for example "Firefox" or "Github Desktop" and makes it borderless windowed, no need for quotes or fancy stuff, just pass in the name with spaces.

This exists because it works really well for minecraft versions which dont play nicely with fullscreen, like 1.12.2.
